    "section": "",
    "text": "We are excited to introduce a new feature at the Annual Conference on Human Sentence Processing (HSP), as part of our NSF-funded special session, ’‘Connecting Minds, Building Bridges: Community Outreach in Language Processing Research.’’ For the first time, we will host a ‘’Demo’’’ period, providing space for hands-on outreach demonstrations that go beyond traditional posters or talks. This is an opportunity to showcase work that can only be fully appreciated through direct experience—such as sounds, multimedia presentations, interactive activities for children, and more.\nWhile the session will focus on live demonstrations, abstracts are required to evaluate and understand the content of these presentations. These abstracts should serve as descriptions of your planned activities and may differ in structure from those typically submitted for traditional poster sessions. We invite abstracts that showcase community-engagement activities in psycholinguistics. These demos should highlight outreach projects that researchers are involved in, featuring the stakeholders you work with—whether they be schools, community organizations, or broader public groups. Presenting real-world examples of successful outreach will illustrate how psycholinguistic research can directly benefit communities and foster meaningful collaboration.\nIn addition to showcasing ongoing efforts, we also encourage abstracts that propose new community engagement initiatives. These proposals can outline your planned activities, highlighting how you aim to involve key stakeholders and promote greater interaction between the scientific community and the public.\nWe encourage abstracts that highlight creative outreach initiatives, interactive demonstrations, and alternative ways of presenting research aligned with the theme of community engagement. Abstracts should include a brief description of the demo, its objectives, and how it connects to the special session theme.\nAlthough we are primarily encouraging demos that highlight creative outreach initiatives and community engagement activities, we also welcome submissions that present innovative experimental methods or approaches. If you have a demonstration that is best understood through direct experience, such as a new experimental technique, this demo period could be an excellent opportunity to share it with the community.\nPresenters of the demos will have approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes for their presentations, which may overlap with a poster session to maximize audience engagement.\nSince this is a new feature, please include any logistical needs (e.g., table, electricity, poster board, etc.) to ensure the space is prepared for your demonstration. All demo abstracts should adhere to the same formatting requirements as traditional abstracts for talks and posters.\nThis demo period provides a unique opportunity for researchers to showcase how their work connects with broader societal needs. By sharing innovative and interactive outreach efforts, participants can highlight the practical, real-world relevance of psycholinguistic research. These demonstrations will help other researchers recognize the potential for their own work to reach and engage the public, fostering stronger connections between the scientific community and the communities we aim to serve.\nWe look forward to your submissions and the exciting potential these demos have to inspire and engage.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "College Park\nThe Board and Brew: College Park, short walk from UMD campus. Decent eats, great single origin coffees, evening brews, and the only place we know with a board game sommelier to advise you on a choice of games. Indoor and outdoor seating.\nThe Hall CP: Main attraction is proximity to campus – right behind The Hotel @ UMD – and the expansive rear patio. Bar, pizzeria, and event spot created by the brother of “the Under Armour guy” (a former UMD football player). The food isn’t memorable, but on a nice evening it can be a very nice place to hang out with friends.\nNorthwest Chinese: Small place in downtown College Park that’s consistently rated as one of the best local eateries. Not your standard American Chinese fare.\nVigilante Coffee: With shops in College Park and Hyattsville, many locals regard this hip roaster as their go-to coffee spot.\nMade in Maryland: A new coffee shop that is very close to the university. They also have selection of pastries and work from local artists.\nSouth Campus Market: To the uneducated eye, it is just a university market and a convenience store. But it is also a place to get the best value/quality ratio double cheeseburger in the entire DMV area. You have to get double cheeseburger with american cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo, and ketchup.\nBagels ’n Grinds: A local favorite for bagels and coffee. They also have a variety of sandwiches and salads.\nTacos a la madre: It is slighly far from the university but it is worth the walk. Their birria tacos are a must try.\n\n\nNearby\nThe strip from College Park to Hyattsville has become surprisingly interesting for eats and drinks in recent years. You could even muster a brewery crawl via the College Park Trolley Trail bike path.\nThe beer (and more) trail. In order of distance from the UMD campus.\nDenizens Brewery: In the new Riverdale Park Station development, next to Whole Foods. Hip local brewery. Co-owner Julie Veratti and her wife started the brewery in 2014. She later ran (unsuccessfully) for Lieutenant Governor, and then was appointed by Pres Biden to the Small Business Administration. The beer’s not bad, either. Outside tables by reservation online.\nBurton’s: In the new Riverdale Park Station development, next to Whole Foods. It’s the kind of respectable-but-not-staid place we might take a visiting speaker. Also, best place in the area for taking food allergies seriously.\nTown Center Market: One of our favorite local hangouts. Next to the Riverdale Park commuter rail station. Quirky liquor store with a popular outdoor beer garden (mix of open and covered/heated), and an impressive range of craft beers on tap. And they encourage customers to bring in take-out food.\n2Fifty Texas BBQ: Same block as Town Center Market. Since opening a couple of years ago it has leapt to the top of lists of best places for BBQ in the DC area. And that’s not damning with faint praise. Recommended to order ahead, as they’re so popular they often sell out.\nBusboys & Poets: Restaurant, bar, and lefty bookstore. It’s where some UMD grad students were surprised to find Noam Chomsky when they showed up late one evening a few years ago (true story!).\nFranklin’s Brewery & General Store: The best combination brew pub and toy store (really!) you will ever encounter. This local favorite is credited with starting the local renaissance 20 years ago. Their big outdoor seating area (‘’Quarantiki Bar’’’), opened during the pandemic, may be back by late March.\nStreetcar 82 Brewery: Named after the trolley line that is now a bike path, this small brewery is run by some Gallaudet U grads and is the only brewery we know that gets quieter over the course of the evening, as the number of ASL speakers increases. Good outdoor seating. No food.\nMaryland Meadworks: There’s more to mead than you thought! They team up with the bakery next door for weekend brunches. Another local favorite.\nAlso, do not forget that the nation’s capital is a surprisingly short (~15 minutes) Metro ride away! Here’s a google maps link for a non-exclusive list of amazing places! The list does not even include the museums!\n\n\nPlanet Word Museum\nPlanet Word is the hottest new addition to the Washington DC museum scene. And it’s all about language! It was designed in consultation with lots of language experts. Nab a free ticket if you can (or try a walk up and hope for the best), and head to the museum that will leave you feeling that it’s cool to be a language nerd!\nAdapted from the guide Colin Phillips prepared for the Maryland in-person satellite event in HSP2022! \n\nShare this post:\n\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Travel\nThe conference will take place in the Grand Ballroom of the Stamp Student Union on Campus Drive. This interactive campus map might also be helpful for navigating.\n\nFrom the Metro\nTo get to College Park via the DC Metro, take the Green Line (direction Greenbelt) to the College Park Station. It is best to buy a reusable SmarTrip card. If instead you buy a new ticket for each ride, you will pay a $1 surcharge for for each ticket. One can also use Apple Wallet or GPay options. There are then two ways to get to Stamp from the Metro Station.\n\nRed Shuttle Bus\nUniversity of Maryland Shuttle Buses to the campus leave regularly from the front (east side) of the station. This is Route 104, which stops at Regent Drive Garage - a five minute walk to the Stamp Student Union.\n\n\nWalking (full map)\nAfter exiting the turnstile in the Metro station, take the pedestrian tunnel under the train platform. Walk through the parking lot to Columbia Avenue, turn right onto Columbia, and walk north about 100m. Then turn left from Columbia onto College Ave. Walk about half a mile west on College Avenue to Route 1, known here as Baltimore Avenue. Cross Route 1 and continue straight on what is now called Regents Drive. Walk along Regents drive, which curves from westward to northward, for 700m, until you reach a traffic circle (called “The M”). Turn left, and walk 400m westward. The Stamp will be on your right, the grand ballroom is on the first floor of the Stamp Student Union.\n\n\n\nAir travel\nGuests traveling to College Park by air have a choice of three airports: Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA), Baltimore-Washington International Airport (BWI), and (least conveniently) Dulles International Airport (IAD).\n\nReagan Washington National Airport (DCA)\nReagan (a.k.a. National) is the most convenient. It is very close to downtown D.C. – near the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia – and has its own Metro stop.\nTo get to College Park from Reagan by Metro, take the Yellow Line, direction Fort Totten, to L’Enfant Plaza. At L’Enfant Plaza, change to the Green Line (direction Greenbelt). Get off the Green Line at College Park Station. During the peak hours of the AM and PM commutes, this transfer is not necessary, and you can take the Yellow Line all the way to College Park. When using the DC Metro it is best to buy a reusable SmarTrip card. If instead you buy a new ticket for each ride, you will pay a $1 surcharge for for each ticket. One can also use Apple Wallet or GPay options. Taxi service to College Park from Reagan costs approximately $40.00, plus a tip. Super Shuttle is also an option. In a shared van, the price is $28, plus $10 per additional person. Reagan is only about 15 miles from the University. But throughout work hours, traffic is terrible. The ride will take at least 30 minutes, but less than one hour.\n\n\nBaltimore-Washington International Airport (BWI)\nFlights to BWI are cheaper than flights to Reagan. It is a hub city for the discount carrier Southwest Airlines, which generates some price competition. BWI has mostly domestic connections, but also a few direct international connections (for example, to the UK and Germany).\nThere is weekday public bus service to BWI from the Greenbelt Metro Station, for only $7.50, on the B30 Metrobus Metrobus (there is no service over the weekend). Greenbelt is just one stop beyond College Park on the Metro Green Line. College Park is about 25 miles from BWI. Taxi service is therefore expensive, in the area of $70. The Super Shuttle costs $32, plus $12 per additional person.\n\n\nWashington-Dulles International Airport (IAD)\nDulles is the main international hub in the region, with direct connections from throughout the US, Europe, and Asia.\nDulles is 25 miles west of downtown D.C, however, and the 40 mile trip from Dulles to College Park is not easy. Options are taxi or shuttle van, or bus-and-metro combination. Taxi service to College Park costs approximately $80. The drive is at least 45 minutes, and most often one hour. Super Shuttle is another option: a shared van is $39, plus $10 per additional person. But be warned! Trips to College Park can be as much as three hours long: in dropping off several customers, the shuttle may follow a circuitous path, and traffic is generally terrible. The cheapest path is by Metro, $11. Take the Silver Line Express Bus ($5) to the Wiehle-Reston Metrorail Station. From there take the Silver Line train, direction Largo Town Center, to L’Enfant Plaza. At L’Enfant Plaza, transfer to the Green Line, direction Greenbelt, and get off in College Park. Under ideal conditions, the combination of bus and Metro ride will talk 90 minutes. But you should plan for a two-hour trip (at least) to be cautious.\nWhen using the DC Metro it is best to buy a reusable SmarTrip card. If instead you buy a new ticket for each ride, you will pay a $1 surcharge for for each ticket. One can also use Apple Wallet or GPay options.\n\n\n\nDriving to College Park\n\nFrom the north\nTake I-95 South to exit 27 for I-495 West (“Silver Spring”). Immediately after this (very gentle) exit, follow signs for Route 1 South (“College Park”), Exit 25. The campus is about 2 miles down Route 1.\n\n\nFrom the south\nTake I-95 North to I-495, the Capital Beltway, which is a continuation of I-95. Continue North on I-95/I-495 toward Baltimore. Take Exit 25 for Route 1 South toward College Park. The campus is about 2 miles down Route 1.\n\n\nParking Info\nA list of parking garages on campus is here. The lot closest to WSCLA is Union Lane Garage, which sits immediately to the west of the Stamp Student Union. Parking on campus is $15/day on weekdays and $5/day on weekends.\nYou can also park in town.\n\n\n\nTravel by Train\n\nAmtrak to College Park\nAmtrak makes two stops in the area, Union Station in Washington, and New Carrollton Station in Maryland.\n\n\nUnion Station (WAS)\nMany trains stop at Union Station, which is on several Amtrak routes: the Acela Express, Northeast Regional, Vermonter, Capitol Limited, The Cardinal, and Silver Service / Palmetto. From Union Station it is easy to get to the University of Maryland by Metro. Take the Red Line (direction Glenmont) to Fort Totten. At Fort Totten, transfer to the Green Line (direction Greenbelt). Get off at College Park Station.\n\n\nNew Carrollton (NCR)\nRelatively few trains stop at New Carrollton. It is served only by theNortheast Regional and Vermonter Routes. The F6 bus from New Carrollton to Silver Spring stops at the University of Maryland. But this bus is not frequent. You may therefore want to take a taxi or ask a local friend for a ride. The station is about 6 miles from the University. The advantage of New Carrollton over Union Station is that this drive is the easier than the 8 miles through city traffic to Union Station.\n\n\nShare this post:"
