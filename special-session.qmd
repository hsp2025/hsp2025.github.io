This year’s special session focuses on enhancing psycholinguists’ ability to appreciate the link between their scientific interests and the needs of the wider community.

* How does our work benefit society?
* How does collaborating with community partners enable research that is informed by societal needs and yield impact outside the academy?
* How can we collaborate with community organizations such as schools, healthcare practices, museums, advocacy groups, and policy makers?
* How can we overcome barriers and challenges associated with this research model, such as establishing public partnerships, aligning research goals with societal interests, and improving public communication?
