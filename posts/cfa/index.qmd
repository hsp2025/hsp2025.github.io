We invite submissions for the Annual Conference on Human Sentence Processing. In addition to soliciting abstracts for traditional podium talks and posters, we are excited to announce a new opportunity for researchers to participate in our interactive demo period.

This demo period aims to foster community engagement by showcasing innovative outreach activities and experimental methods that benefit from hands-on experience. Researchers are encouraged to submit abstracts that highlight creative initiatives, interactive demonstrations, and alternative presentations aligned with our conference theme. View detailed abstract submission instructions for our special session [''Demo period''](../demo/index.html).

For detailed instructions on how to submit your abstracts for both traditional presentations and the new demo period, please refer to the [submission guidelines](#abstract-specifications).

We look forward to your contributions and to making this conference an engaging and impactful experience for all attendees!
