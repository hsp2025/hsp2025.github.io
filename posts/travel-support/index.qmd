## Equity and Access Support

#### Registration Supplement

We will subsidize the cost of attendance by covering the registration fees for approximately 55 undergraduate and graduate students, including those in UMD's REACH Program, students from local HBCUs, MSIs, and Gallaudet University, at a rate of $150 per participant.

#### Travel Supplement

We will provide travel supplements of $50 each to 40 students who receive the Equity and Access Award, specifically to assist with travel costs for those coming from local HBCUs, MSIs, and Gallaudet University located outside the immediate area.
